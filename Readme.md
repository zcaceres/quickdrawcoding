# QuickdrawJS
## A Wild-West Adventure through Javascript

QuickdrawJS takes in an arbitrary-length string of code (as textfile, XML, or HTML) and transforms it into a Wild West shooting gallery!

Type the letters as they appear. Go as fast as you can. Each time you miss, you lose a point. Each time you hit, you get a point.

- Spaces will prompt you when they appear.
- Reload on newlines ('\n') by pressing ENTER!

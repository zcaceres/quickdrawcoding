# QuickdrawJS
## A Wild-West Adventure through Javascript

QuickdrawJS: the world's first Wild West adventure about typing code accurately!

<!-- TODO ANIMATED GIF -->

## TWO MODES
### Shooting Gallery
Takes in an arbitrary-length string of code (as textfile, XML, or HTML) and transforms it into a Wild West shooting gallery!

Type the letters as they appear. Go as fast as you can. Each time you miss, you lose a point. Each time you hit, you get a point.

- Spaces will prompt you when they appear.
- Watch out for TABs and SPACEs!
- Reload on newlines ('\n') by pressing ENTER

~~### Coming Soon: A New Duel Mode!~~
~~> Note: A basic duel mode was written for the hackathon, but was removed because the gameplay proved too confusing for players.~~

~~For two players. Played on the same computer. One player types the code that appears. The other player controls the mouse.~~

~~When the typing player makes a mistake, a small opportunity will appear for the mouse-controlling player to click and FIRE! If the mouse-controlling player clicks outside of that window, the typing player can press the spacebar to FIRE!~~

~~Players alternate after each code block.~~

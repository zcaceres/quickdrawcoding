# QuickdrawJS
## A Wild-West Adventure through Javascript

QuickdrawJS takes in an arbitrary-length string of code (as textfile, XML, or HTML) and transforms it into a Wild West shooting gallery!

Type the letters as they appear. Go as fast as you can. Each time you miss, you lose a point. Each time you hit, you get a point.

## TWO MODES
### Shooting Gallery
Type letters as fast and as accurately as possible!
- Spaces will prompt you when they appear.
- Reload on newlines ('\n') by pressing ENTER!

### Duel
Multiplayer, played on the same computer. One player types the code that appears. The other player controls the mouse.

When the typing player makes a mistake, a small opportunity will appear for the mouse-controlling player to click and FIRE! If the mouse-controlling player clicks outside of that window, the typing player can press the spacebar to FIRE!

Player alternate after each code block.
